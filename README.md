# Astroshot 0.9.2

**Earth's last hope is in your hands, take control of the space cannon and protect the Earth from asteroids.**

Control the space cannon with the phone's gyroscope and accelerometer to keep the Earth safe from asteroids. The cannon can be controlled by moving your phone or tablet to the left or right. 

You'll also have to deal with falling space capsules and nuclear bombs. Shooting space capsules should be avoided. There might be astronauts on board. You'll get bonus points for saving space capsules.

> **Have fun and enjoy the game!**
